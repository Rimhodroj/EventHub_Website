EventHub platform, admins and organizers play crucial roles in ensuring a seamless event management experience. Admins are responsible for overseeing the platform by reviewing and approving or rejecting event submissions based on criteria such as compliance, content quality, and scheduling conflicts; when events are approved, automated email notifications are sent to users on mobile app. Organizers, on the other hand, can easily create, update, and manage their event listings, including adding images, descriptions, and pricing, all from their dedicated dashboard. Both roles work together to maintain high-quality event listings and ensure a smooth user experience for attendees.
